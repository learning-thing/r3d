# R3D Roadmap

## **v0.10**

* [ ] **Implement Auto Exposure**
  Can be done by downsampling the scene texture and basing the effect on the final 1x1 mip level.
  We could also expose the downsampled version of the scene for custom screen shaders.

* [x] **Add a render priority index to `R3D_Material`**
  Add a signed integer indicating render priority in materials, in order to control whether certain objects should be rendered before or after others.
  It should integrate easily with the existing material-based sorting.

* [ ] **Add layer mask support for shadows**
  Allows rendering an object in the scene without rendering its shadows.
  Or rendering only the object's shadows without rendering the object itself, using the camera layer mask.
  _(in addition to the existing shadow casting mode, this will allow for more different configurations per light)_

* [ ] **Add shadow opacity parameter**
  Allows controlling the transparency of shadows relative to the light.

* [ ] **Add specular parameter in the ORM map**
  Allows controlling specularity per material (in relation to metalness) instead of only through the lights.

## **Ideas (Not Planned Yet)**

* [ ] Think about introducing a dedicated `R3D_Camera` that handles `cullMask` per camera (instead of using global state) and manages `near/far` parameters directly, removing the last dependency on `rlgl`.
* [ ] Investigate the integration of a velocity buffer and frame history, mainly for TAA and motion blur. The current begin/end rendering model makes this non-trivial.
* [ ] Improve support for shadow/transparency interaction (e.g., colored shadows).
* [ ] Implement Cascaded Shadow Maps (or alternative) for directional lights.
* [ ] Make wiki pages for the repo, consider it for the release.
